## Privacy

The only data from the users that are saved on the server are the public prompt shared by the community. The user name and email are also saved. By using this extension, you agree to join our daily AI newsletter. You can opt out of the newsletter at any time. You can see the newsletter here (https://www.superpowerdaily.com/) before you agree to this.
